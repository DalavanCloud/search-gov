class Object

  # backported from Rails 3:
  # https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/1c47d04ea5ac19601b316daf8fdc6f38c50eec73

  # Returns object if it's #present? otherwise returns nil.
  # object.presence is equivalent to object.present? ? object : nil.
  #
  # This is handy for any representation of objects where blank is the same
  # as not present at all.  For example, this simplifies a common check for
  # HTTP POST/query parameters:
  #
  #   state   = params[:state]   if params[:state].present?
  #   country = params[:country] if params[:country].present?
  #   region  = state || country || 'US'
  #
  # ...becomes:
  #
  #   region = params[:state].presence || params[:country].presence || 'US'
  def presence
    self if present?
  end

end
