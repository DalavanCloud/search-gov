Pig "session based" related queries

* compute top 25k queries in logs
* find contiguous sessions in AOL logs (basic approach = same anonID, date)
* compute co-occurence of queries within sessions, limited to top 25k queries
* group pairs of queries to form co-occurence, emit counts
* compute TFIDF on co-occurence for top 25k
* for each query in top 25k, sort by TFIDF desc, return top 25 "related queries"

Pig "click url based" related queries

* repeat top 25k selection used in session approach
* group queries by click url
* compute TFIDF score for co-occurence based on click url

--------------------------
TODO:

* omit queries with empty strings
* apply TFIDF pig code
* Change ClickUrl name in pig scripts to Affiliate
* Frequency counts of queries by AnonId
* Frequency counts of queries by Date
* Frequency counts of queries by Affiliate
* Top Queries by affiliate
* instead of removing large sessions, downsample, i.e. replace this line: sessions = FILTER sessions BY (count >1) AND (count <=500);
* try relaxing session definition to be same AnonId and month.
* Form matrix of AnonId x Queries , where Anonid has > 1 query.  Run NMF or SVD on Matrix,
  use basis vectors to expand number of queries in user sessions.  Recompute related searches.
* look at simple query chain, sequential queries from global session frequency.. most often after obama, people search for X.. just emit sequential query pairs based on user in sliding window over ordered user history.  logical break due to activity / session change will wash out.  Alternatively can use sliding time window.
* basic topic related queries based on wikipedia link graph for entity exact matches (with redirect fixes)  Barack obama, nancy pelosi etc.  Use grouping related trends blog post.  Use wikipedia redirect based tweet entity ngram tagger from spatialanalytics github project.

queries_extract_pii_20100421.bz2 contains full anonymized PII stripped query logs from usasearch.gov and affiliates over the last 2 years (as of 4/21/2010)

Entries have the following format
(query:chararray, user_hash:chararray, timestamp:chararray, affiliate:chararray, locale:chararray, agent:chararray, is_bot:chararray);

locale, agent, and is_bot are all NULL in the current extract and can be ignored for now.
