I noticed you registered for a new USASearch account a few days ago so I wanted to follow up to see if you have any questions. Also, if you haven't already, be sure to check out our How To Manual.

I also wanted to point out some features that I see you haven't set up in the Admin Center.

<% @affiliates_with_unused_features.each do |affiliate| %>
<%= affiliate.name %>:
<% affiliate.unused_features.each do |feature| %>
<%= feature.display_name %>
<% end %>

<% end %>

We look forward to working with you.
