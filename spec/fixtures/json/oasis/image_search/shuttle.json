    "title": "Five Space Legends: Former shuttle and Apollo astronauts today toured the refurbished Operations and Checkout Building, newly named for Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first person to set foot on the moon. Viewing the Orion crew module stacked on top of the service module from left, are former shuttle astronaut and Kennedy Center Director Bob Cabana, Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins, Apollo astronaut Jim Lovell, Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, and former shuttle astronaut and NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden. The building's high bay is being used to support the agency's new Orion spacecraft, which will lift off atop the Space Launch System. Orion is designed to take humans farther than they've ever gone before, serving as the exploration vehicle that will carry astronauts to deep space and sustain the crew during travel to destinations such as an asteroid or Mars. \nImage Credit: NASA/Kim Shiflett\n\n#nasa #pathtomars #apollo45 #apollo11 #nextgiantleap #neilarmstrong",
