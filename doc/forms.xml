<Description>These information collections are used by EDA to evaluate and select for funding those investment proposals satisfying EDA statutory, regulatory and programmatic requirements. EDA proposes to eliminate its two-step process of a Form ED-900P Pre-Application and a Form ED-900A Application into one ED-900 Application. The ED-900 consolidates the ED-900P and the ED-900A, eliminating redundant questions. It eliminates paperwork for the applicant and shortens application processing times. It also allows for greater ease of use when filing electronic applications; www.grants.gov has no mechanism for handling the two-step application procedure EDA currently has in place. Approximately a 50 percent decrease in burden hours is expected to complete the consolidated application from 37,550 hours currently to 18,956 hours for the proposed consolidated application. This decrease is due largely to the reduction in total preparation time for the Pre-Application and Application combined from the 46 hours previously estimated to the 21.66 hours estimated for the streamlined one-step application.</Description>

<Bureau>National Institute of Standards and Technology</Bureau>
<Description>Over the last 13 years, the Building and Fire Research Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed and automated an approach for measuring the life-cycle environmental and economic performance of building products. Known as BEES (Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability), the tool reduces complex, science-based technical content (e.g., over 400 material and energy flows from raw material extraction through product disposal) to decision-enabling results and delivers them in a visually intuitive graphical format. BEES Please is a voluntary program to collect data from product manufacturers so that the environmental performance of their products may be evaluated scientifically using BEES. NIST will publish in BEES an aggregated version of the data collected from manufacturers that protects data confidentiality, subject to manufacturer&apos;s review and approval. BEES measures environmental performance using the environmental life-cycle assessment approach specified in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14040 series of standards. All stages in the life of a product are analyzed: Raw material acquisition, manufacture, transportation, installation, use, and recycling and waste management. Economic performance is measured using the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard life-cycle cost method, which covers the costs of initial investment, replacement, operation, maintenance and repair, and disposal.</Description>

<Description>A work-sharing pilot program called the ??New Route?? is being established between the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the Japan Patent Office (JPO). Under the New Route, a filing in one member office of this arrangement would be deemed a filing in all member offices. The first office and applicant would be given a 30-month processing time frame in which to make available a first office action and any necessary translations to the second office(s), and the second office(s) would exploit the search and examination results of the first office in conducting their own examination. The information collection includes one proposed form, Request for Participation in the New Route Pilot Program Between the JPO and the USPTO (PTO/SB/10), which will be added to this collection. The USPTO believes that the primary respondents will be businesses or other for-profits, but not-for-profit institutions may also submit information under this collection.</Description>

<Form_x0020_Number>ED 524 </Form_x0020_Number>
<Agency>Department of Education</Agency>
<Description>The ED-524 Budget Information Non-Construction Programs Form and Instructions were previously part of another collection, OMB Control number 1890-0004. The 1890-0004 collection currently includes three distinct information collection instruments, the ED 524 Budget Form, the ED 524B Grant Performance Report and the administrative requirements in the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR). As part of the renewal of these instruments, we are requesting that each of the instruments be approved under separate OMB Control numbers. Separating these instruments into three information collections will make it easier to make additions deletions, revisions or other needed changes to each instrument throughout the approval period and eliminate any potential confusion when changes are made to only one of the instruments. We are requesting a new OMB Control number for the ED 524, Budget Form and a three year approval. Please note that the ED 524B, Grant Performance Report will retain the 1890-0004 number. The ED 524 form and instructions are included in U.S. Department of Education (ED) discretionary grant application packages and are needed in order for applicants to submit summary-level budget data by budget category, as well as a detailed budget narrative, to request and justify their proposed grant budgets which are part of their grant applications.</Description>

<Description>The U.S. Department of Education (ED) information collection package, OMB Control number 1890-0004, currently includes three distinct information collection instruments: the ED 524 Budget Form, the ED 524B Grant Performance Report and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements in the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR). As part of the renewal of these instruments, ED is requesting that each of these information collection instruments be approved under separate OMB control numbers. The ED 524B will retain the 1890-0004 control number. In this information collection package, ED is requesting a three year renewal of the ED 524B with the understanding that once the government-wide Performance Progress Report is implemented, ED will transition to the new form. In separate information collection packages, ED is requesting a new OMB control number for the ED 524, Budget Information Form and Instructions and a new OMB control number for the EDGAR administrative requirements. The ED 524B form and instructions are used in order for grantees to meet ED deadline dates for submission of performance reports for Department discretionary grant programs. Recipients of multi-year discretionary grants must submit an annual performance report for each year funding has been approved in order to receive a continuation award. The annual performance report should demonstrate whether substantial progress has been made toward meeting the approved goals and objectives of the project. ED program offices may also require recipients of ??forward funded?? grants that are awarded funds for their entire multi-year project up-front in a single grant award to submit the ED 524B on an annual basis. In addition, ED program offices may also require recipients to use the ED 524B to submit their final performance reports to demonstrate project success, impact and outcomes. In both the annual and final performance reports, grantees are required to provide data on established performance measures for the grant program (e.g., Government Performance and Results Act measures) and on project performance measures that were included in the grantee??s approved grant application. The ED 524B also contains a number of questions related to project financial data such as Federal and non-Federal expenditures and indirect cost information. Performance reporting requirements are found in 34 CFR 74.51, 75.118, 75.253, 75.590 and 80.40 of the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR).</Description>

<Description>This collection-of-information affords an increasingly more efficient and accurate database for monitoring and management of the groundfish fisheries of the Exclusive Economic Zone in the waters off Alaska for purposes of conservation of the fisheries as well as for the enforcement of fisheries regulations. Parts of this collection are also used by the fishermen recording catch information on the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands crab fisheries, and the Individual Fishing Quota Program for Pacific halibut. This action is a revision of this collection to incorporate the increased use of an electronic reporting system, eLandings, and the decreased use of paper logbooks and forms. An earlier version was pre-approved, but had to be withdrawn, as the final rule was not ready for publication before renewal of this collection was due.</Description>

<Description>Under 35 U.S.C. ?? 2 and 37 CFR 1.31-1.36, this information collection is used by the public to grant or revoke power of attorney in a patent application, to withdraw as attorney or agent of record, to authorize a practitioner to act in a representative capacity, to change the correspondence address for one or more applications or patents, to request a Customer Number, to designate or change the correspondence address or list of practitioners associated with a Customer Number, and to associate a patent application with a Customer Number. The USPTO??s Customer Number practice permits authorized individuals to change the correspondence address or representatives of record for a number of applications or patents with one change request instead of filing separate requests for each application or patent. The USPTO uses the information in this collection to determine who is authorized to take action in an application or patent on behalf of the applicant or assignee and where to send correspondence regarding an application or patent.</Description>

<Description>The annual National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a major source of general statistics on the health of the U.S. population and has been in the field every year since 1957. This household-based survey collects demographic and health-related information on a nationally representative sample of households throughout the country. The NHIS has long been used by government, university, and private researchers to evaluate both general health and specific issues, such as cancer, diabetes, and access to health care. It is a leading source of data for the Congressionally-mandated &quot;Health US&quot; and related publications, as well as the single most important source of statistics to track progress toward the National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives, &quot;Healthy People 2010.&quot; In accordance with the 1995 initiative to increase the integration of surveys within the Department of Health and Human Services, respondents to the NHIS serve as the sampling frame for the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.</Description>

<Description>The Non-Hiring Progress Report (NHPR) solicits information about COPS grantees?? progress toward implementation of their COPS Non-Hiring grants and their community policing activities. To help manage the monitoring of grants, the COPS Office must obtain updated information from grantees at regular intervals. The new NHPR was part of a business process improvement effort aimed at minimizing the reporting burden on COPS grantees by streamlining the collection of progress report information into one annual report (or quarterly reports as required for community policing development grantees. Once OMB approves this report and it is developed online (online development completion expected January, 2008), the COPS Office plans to eliminate the following progress reports that have been in use: Training and Technical Assistance Semi-Annual Status Report (1103-0043); Mental Health and Community Safety Initiative Equipment and Training Progress Report (1103-0078); Tribal Resources Grant Program Equipment/Training Progress Report (1103-0087); Methamphetamine Project Final Update Report (1103-0091); and the Methamphetamine Project, Status Update Report (SUR) (1103-0092). In addition, the Annual Report to Congress-Expired COPS Awards Exceeding $5 million (1103-0099) will be modified to include only hiring grants.</Description>

<Description>DHS TRIP Traveler Inquiry Form The Traveler Inquiry Form (TIF) is the form used to support the Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP), which will serve as a centralized intake office for traveler redress requests. After receipt, TRIP then passes the information to the relevant DHS component to process the request as appropriate (e.g., TRIP passes the form to TSA to initiate the Watch List Clearance Procedure). Individuals who feel that they have been unnecessarily subjected to additional screening, or denied or delayed boarding, or entry into or departure from the U.S. may complete the form. This form will be used by DHS to determine if there is an error in their record. This collection also serves to help DHS distinguish individuals from an actual individual on a watch list used by DHS, and it helps streamline and expedite future check-in or border crossing experiences.</Description>

<Description>In the verification process, a participating agency validates an applicant??s immigration status by inputting identifying information into the Verification Information System (VIS), which executes immigration status queries against a range of data sources. If VIS returns an immigration status and the benefit-issuing agency does not find a material discrepancy with the response and the documents provided by the applicant, the verification process is complete. Then, the agency may use that immigration status information in determining whether or not to issue the benefit. In some cases, agencies that do not access the automated verification system may query USCIS by filing Form G-845. There is also a document called the Form G-845S that was developed for use by only the agencies that administered the benefits mandated by IRCA.</Description>

<Form_x0020_Number> 8110-3 </Form_x0020_Number>
<Agency>Department of Transportation</Agency>
<Bureau>Federal Aviation Administration</Bureau>
<Description>This action is part of the FAA&apos;s Fuel Tank Flammability Safety rulemaking. The rulemaking requires the manufacturers to provide a report to the FAA every six months for up to 5 years after the flammability reduction system is incorporated into the fleet. The safety benefits of the flammability reduction system is highly dependent upon the reliability of the system. Therefore the data collection is needed to assure system performance meets that predicted at the time of certification. There is no requirement for the operators to provide data to the FAA. Manufactures will arrange for data collection from the operators through business agreements and their normal data sharing processes. This proposal would require that a program to preclude the existence of Widespread Fatigue Damage (WFD) be incorporated in the FAA-approved maintenance or inspection program of each operator of transport category airplanes with a maximum gross takeoff weight greater than 75,000 pounds.</Description>

<Form_x0020_Number>FHWA 1563 </Form_x0020_Number>
<Agency>Department of Transportation</Agency>
<Bureau>Federal Highway Administration</Bureau>
<Description>Title 23, United States Code, Section 141, provides that a State??s apportionment of funds under 23 U.S.C. 104(b)(5) shall be reduced in an amount up to 25% of the amount to be apportioned during any fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1984, during which vehicles subject to the Federal heavy vehicle use tax are lawfully registered without having presented proof of payment of the tax. Under the broad rulemaking authority granted to the Secretary of Transportation by 23 U.S.C. 315, the FHWA has determined that an annual certification of compliance by each State is the least obtrusive means of administering the provisions of the legislative mandate. The final regulation issued as 23 CFR 669. The reporting requirement consists of a simple certification submitted on an annual basis by the Governor or designated official of each State. The recordkeeping requirement consists of the retention of Schedule 1, IRS Form 2290 , (or other suitable alternative provided by the regulation) by the States for a period of one year as evidence of compliance with 23 U.S.C. 141. This information collection supports the DOT Strategic Goal of Safety by strengthening the FHWA??s enforcement to promote maximum compliance with its regulations. Each State is required to certify that pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 141, proof of payment of the Federal Heavy Vehicle Use Tax is being obtained prior to registration of vehicles subject to the tax.</Description>

<Description>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), provides the State Departments of Transportation and Federal Lands Agencies with $27.5 billion for highway infrastructure investment. With these funds also comes an increased level of data reporting with the stated goal of improving transparency and accountability at all levels of government. According to President Obama ??Every American will be able to hold Washington accountable for these decisions by going online to see how and where their tax dollars are being spent.?? The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in concert with the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) and the other modes within the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) will be taking the appropriate steps to ensure that this accountability and transparency is in place for all infrastructure investments. The reporting requirements of the ARRA are covered in Sections 1201 and 1512. Specifically Section 1512 or the ??Jobs Accountability Act?? requires ??any entity that receives recovery funds directly from the Federal Government (including recovery funds received through grant, loan, or contract) other than an individual,?? including States, to provide regular ??Recipient Reports.??</Description>

<Description>The MMS uses the collected information to support the Compliance and Asset Management (CAM) and Financial Management (FM) processes, and to assure that royalties are reported timely and paid appropriately and are based upon correct product valuation. The MMS, as well as other Federal Government, state, and tribal entities, uses the collected information for audit purposes and for evaluation of the reasonableness of product valuation or of allowance claims submitted by lessees. The MMS provides the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) access to this information. The BLM and BIA use this data to conduct production verification, ensure lease diligence, and monitor plant efficiencies, maximum recovery, and secondary product inventories. The determination of the appropriate product value or allowance rate directly affects the royalties due. Failure to collect such data would prevent the Secretary from accomplishing statutory and trust responsibilities.</Description>

<Form_x0020_Number>MMS- 4377 </Form_x0020_Number>
<Agency>Department of the Interior</Agency>
<Bureau>Minerals Management Service</Bureau>
<Description>The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is responsible for the royalty management functions assigned to the Secretary who is required by various laws to manage mineral resources production on Federal and Indian lands, collect the royalties due, and distribute the funds in accordance with those laws. Under 43 CFR 3103.4-2, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) established the Stripper Royalty Rate Reduction Program. As a benefit under this program, BLM approved royalty rate reductions for operators of stripper oil properties for applicable sales periods from October 1, 1992, through January 31, 2006. Effective February 1, 2006, BLM terminated the benefits of reduced royalty rates under this program, although this change is not currently reflected in the CFR. For production through January 31, 2006, reporters used Form MMS-4377, Stripper Royalty Rate Reduction Notification, to notify MMS of royalty rate changes. Although the benefits were terminated, MMS continues to verify previously submitted notifications and may require the operator to submit an amended Form MMS-4377.</Description>

<Description>Market value is a basic principle underlying royalty valuation. Therefore, MMS has developed methods to capture the true market value of crude oil and gas produced from Federal leases, both onshore and offshore. The regulations mandate that companies collect and/or submit information used to value their Federal oil and gas, including transportation and processing regulatory allowance limit information.</Description>

<Bureau>U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service</Bureau>
<Description>The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 711) requires the Secretary of the Interior (Fish and Wildlife Service) to implement a viable and ongoing program for the protection and conservation of various migratory birds. The North American Woodcock Singing Ground Survey is an essential part of the migratory bird management program and provides the data necessary to determine the population status of the woodcock. In addition, the information is vital in assessing the relative changes in the geographic distribution of the woodcock. Federal, State, Provincial, tribal, and local wildlife agencies in the United States and Canada work cooperatively to monitor woodcock populations.</Description>

<Description>Section 8 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531-43) authorizes the establishment of the Wildlife Without Borders-Critically Endangered Species Conservation Fund to fund projects that conserve the world&apos;s most endangered species. Critically endangered species are those that face an extremely high risk of extinction in the immediate future. Funding is limited to vertebrate species with natural habitat ranges in developing countries. Applicants must submit an application containing ample information to support informed proposal selection. A panel of technical experts reviews each proposal to assess how well the proposed project addresses the requirements and priorities identified in the program??s Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA). The information we plan to collect will ensure that sufficient information is provided to allow reviewers to select proposals for funding.</Description>

<Agency>Environmental Protection Agency</Agency>
<Bureau>Air and Radiation</Bureau>
<Description>Title VI of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act) implements the obligation of the United States under the Montreal Protocol to phase out the use of ozone-depleting substances. Section 612 of Title VI establishes as U.S. policy the requirement that Class I and Class II ozone-depleting substances shall be replaced, to the maximum extent practicable, by chemicals, product substitutes, or alternative manufacturing processes that reduce overall risks to human health and the environment. EPA developed its Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program to fulfill the requirements of Section 612. The five major provisions of Section 612 are: Rulemaking; Listing of Unacceptable/Acceptable Substitutes; Petition Process; 90-day notification; and Clearinghouse. Information required to be collected under the SNAP program is intended to fulfill the general mandate in Section 612(c) of identifying acceptable substitutes that can serve as replacements for ozone-depleting substances being phased out under the Act, as well as unacceptable substances which may not be used as replacements for ozone-depleting substances being phased out under the Act. Respondents for reporting requirements, as well as for the recordkeeping requirement for the exemption for small volume use, include manufacturers, importers, formulators and processors of substitutes for ozone-depleting substances. Principally, these respondents are in the following major categories of industry groups, by Standard Industry Code (SIC) and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS): Manufacturers, Chemicals and Allied Products; Manufactures, Rubber and Misc. Plastics Products; and Wholesale Trade - Nondurable Goods. The respondents for the narrowed use limit recordkeeping requirement include end users of the substitutes in the following industrial sectors: Construction - Special Trade Contractors; Manufacturing - Industrial Machinery and Equipment; Manufacturing - Electronic and Other Electric Equipment; Manufacturing - Transportation Equipment; and Services.</Description>

<Name>Sun Wise Registration Form</Name>
<Form_x0020_Number> 5900-87 </Form_x0020_Number>
<Agency>Environmental Protection Agency</Agency>
<Bureau>Air and Radiation</Bureau>
<Description>The SunWise Program was initiated in 1998 through a statutory mandate under Title IV of the Clean Air Act. The long term objective of the SunWise Program is to reduce the incidence of, and morbidity and mortality from, skin cancer, cataracts, and other ultraviolet (UV) related health effects in the United States. Short term objectives include (1) reducing the risk of childhood overexposure to the sun by changing the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of elementary school children and their caregivers, and (2) improving the availability of accurate, timely, and useful UV data directly to schools and communities across the United States. The SunWise Program builds on traditional health education practices through the use of existing curricula, learning standards, scientific strategies, and evaluation mechanisms. The Program is a collaborative effort of schools, communities, health professionals, educators, environmental organizations, meteorologists, local governments, federal agencies, and others. Participating schools and partners sponsor classroom and school activities to raise childrens awareness of stratospheric ozone depletion, UV radiation, and the largely preventable health risks from overexposure to the sun, as well as simple sun safety practices. All educators interested in participating in this partnership program are asked to register using the online form (www.epa.gov/sunwise/becoming.html and www.epa.gov/sunwise/becoming partner.html) or a hard copy version distributed by EPA. EPA will use the information provided through this registration to maintain a database of participating schools and organizations and a mailing list for information distribution purposes. Participating schools and organizations receive a variety of materials, including a classroom Tool Kit of games, songs, puzzles, story books, videos, access to the internet UV intensity mapping/graphing tools, and more. The Tool Kit also includes sample sun safety policies and guidelines to help expand the sun safety message beyond the classroom. Teachers who sign up for SunWise are asked to complete a survey at the end of program implementation. Results of these surveys are used to fine tune existing SunWise materials and develop new ones that better meet our participants needs. Randomly selected teachers are also asked to administer a brief survey to their students before and after program implementation. The results from the student surveys are used to evaluate program effectiveness and also help guide materials development. The surveys will be mailed out to Program participants once they have registered. Survey responses are voluntary and anonymous. Additionally, SunWise is developing an online interactive SunWise Sun Safety Certification Program. When it is up and running, the certification program will allow for students, adults, organizations, and employers to develop credentials on sun safety awareness and behaviors. In order to gauge the certification programs effectiveness, we will be collecting a small amount of information including the users first initial and last name, type of user, length of time to complete the tutorial, percentage of individuals who start the tutorial that complete it, percentage of tutorial completed by each user, and the accuracy of individuals completing the tutorial. Users types include informal educators (at camps, parks, recreation programs, museums, science and health education centers, sports organizations, lifeguards, childcare and after school programs, high schools, colleges and university staff and students working with youth, health and medical organizations, etc.), children in grades K to 8, and teachers and other school staff. This project is still in development.</Description>

<Agency>Environmental Protection Agency</Agency>
<Description>Section 112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) mandates that EPA promulgate regulations and develop guidance to prevent, detect, and respond to accidental releases. The regulations are codified in 40 CFR Part 68. Stationary sources covered by these regualtions must develop and implement a risk management program that includes a hazard assessment, a prevention program, and an emergency response program. The risk management prgram must be described in a risk managemnt plan (RMP) that must be registered with EPA. The first RMP submission software (RMP_Submit) was available to the public in February 1999. EPA is in the process of revising the regulations and a new version of RMP_Submit will be available in the URL above.</Description>

<Description>EPA will initiate a voluntary information collection to assemble known or reasonably ascertainable information from manufacturers, importers, and processors of nanoscale materials who are participating in the voluntary Stewardship Program for Nanoscale Materials. EPA will also collaborate with participants and other stakeholders in an effort to generate more detailed information about specific nanoscale materials. Under this second effort OPPT and program participants will work together to generate data and analyses that will more fully characterize certain nanoscale materials to increase understanding of the environmental health and safety implications of manufactured nanoscale materials. In addition to its use as part of the voluntary Stewardship Program for Nanoscale Materials, this data collection will complement EPAs new and existing chemical programs under TSCA because the data will help provide a better understanding of nanoscale materials and the need to amend assessment or analytical measures to address potentially unique characteristics. It will also encourage the development of key scientific information and appropriate risk management practices for nanoscale chemical substances.</Description>

<Description>EPAs Water Efficiency Program is a voluntary program designed to create self-sustaining markets for water efficient products and services via a common label. The program provides incentives for manufacturers to design, produce, and market water-efficient products. In addition, the program provides incentives for service providers (e.g., landscapers) to deliver water-efficient products. The program also encourages consumers and commercial and institutional purchasers of water-using products and systems to choose water-efficient products and engage in water-efficient practices. EPAs Water Efficiency Program partners with manufacturers, retailers, utilities, state and local governments, NGOs, plumbers, developers, contractors, architects, landscapers, irrigation professionals, and service certification programs to market and adopt the Water Efficiency Program, and provide labeled products and programs. To participate in the program, organizations will complete a Partnership Agreement, which details the partner and EPA commitments under the program, and is signed by a senior official at both EPA and the partner organization. EPA asks manufacturers, certification programs, and builders to submit an EPA Water Efficiency Program New Certified Product Notification Form within 12 months of execution of the Partnership Agreement. This document provides EPA information to verify that the product or service meets EPA specifications based on independent testing. EPA will use this information to inform the public on water efficient products and services. In addition, EPA requests partners submit promotional plans and annual updates on progress implementing the program. EPA intends to use this information to identify partnership opportunities and assess progress meeting program goals. In the third year of the program, EPA plans to initiate an awards program that will require interested partners to submit an awards application form. Participation in the awards program is strictly voluntary. The purpose this information collection is to document partner successes for further recognition. Partners may designate certain information submitted under this ICR as confidential business information. All information identified as confidential business information collected under this ICR will not be available to the public. Participation on the awards program is entirely voluntary.</Description>

<Form_x0020_Number> 387 </Form_x0020_Number>
<Agency>Federal Communications Commission</Agency>
<Description>On April 25, 2007, the Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), In the Matter of the Commission&apos;s Third Periodic Review of the Commission&apos;s Rules and Policies Affecting the Conversion to Digital Television, MB Docket No. 07-91, FCC 07-70. This is a review of the transition of the nation&apos;s broadcast television system from analog to digital television. Congress has mandated that after February 17, 20098, full-power television broadcast stations must transmit only digital signals and may not use analog signals. This NPRM among other things proposes to require all full-power television stations to file a FCC Form 387 with the Commission detailing their transition status.</Description>

<Name>Competitive Carriers High Cost Data Submission</Name>
<Form_x0020_Number>FCC Form 525 </Form_x0020_Number>
<Agency>Federal Communications Commission</Agency>
<Description>On July 29, 2008, the Commission adopted the Competitive ETC Interim Cap Order. The order adopted an interim, emergency cap on the amount of high-cost support that competitive ETC&apos;s in each state are eligible to receive beginning March 2008 on an annualized basis. The Commission also adopted two limited exceptions from the application of the interim cap. First, a competitive ETC will not be subject to the interim cap to the extent it files cost data demonstrating that its costs meet the support threshold in the same manner as the incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC); and second, the Commission also created a limited exception for competitive ETCs serving tribal lands or Alaska Native regions. A competitive ETC may voluntarily participate in this limited exception on a study area by study area basis. The uncapped per line support is limited to one payment per each residential account. Finally, the Commission combined OMB Control Number 3060-0793 into this collection. FCC Form 525 will be used to gather information needed in a standardized format to help eliminate duplication of information collected. The information will be used to determine whether and to what extent rural incumbent telecommunications carriers providing the data are eligible to receive universal service support.</Description>

The Commission may attach conditions to any exemption and may, by order, revoke any exemption.&quot; 46 CFR 531 exempts NVOCCs from the otherwise applicable statutory and regulatory requirements of the Shipping Act and FMC&apos;s tariff regulations for service arrangements they reach with their shippers. The exemption is conditioned upon the filing of these service arrangements by the NVOCC offering the service. These regulations also ensure compliance with the licensing and financial responsibility requirements of the Shipping Act. The respondents to the information collection are NVOCCs.</Description>

An accident is defined as an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft that takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight and all such persons have disembarked, and in which any person suffers death or serious injury, or in which the aircraft receives substantial damage. An incident is an occurrence other than an accident that affects or could affect the safety of operations (49 CFR 830). The report should be filed with the nearest NTSB regional office. A phone call is sufficient initially, but a written follow-up will be required.</Description>

<Description>Under IRS regulations, employers are obligated to provide wage and tax data to the Social Security Administration using Form W-2 or its electronic equivalent. As part of this process, the employer must furnish the employee&apos;s name and their Social Security number (SSN). The employee&apos;s name and SSN must match SSA&apos;s records in order for the employee&apos;s earnings to be properly posted to their Earnings Record, which is maintained by SSA. In order to better assure that employers provide accurate name and SSN data that match SSA&apos;s records, SSA offers several methods for employers to verify the names and numbers of hired individuals. SSA offers a free and secure Internet- based service, known as the Social Security Number Verification Service (SSNVS), where the employer can verify if the reported names and SSNs of their employees matches SSA&apos;s records. SSA also offers a service, Employee Verification Service (EVS), where employers can verify, via cartridge, diskette, paper, and telephone if the reported name and SSN of their employees matches SSA&apos;s records. Finally, through our National 800 Number SSA is introducing an automated telephone employee verification service (TNEV) that will ask callers for pertinent information in order to first authenticate them and then assist them with verifying an employee&apos;s SSN and name.</Description>

The agreements further provide that upon the request of the worker or employer, the country under whose system the period of work is covered will issue a certificate of coverage. The certificate serves as proof of exemption from coverage and taxation under the system of the other country. The information collected is needed to determine if a period of work is covered by the U.S. system under an agreement and to issue a certificate of coverage. The respondents are workers and employers wishing to establish an exemption from foreign Social Security taxes.</Description>
