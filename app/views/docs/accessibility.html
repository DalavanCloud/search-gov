<h1>Accessibility</h1>

<p>The Search.USA.gov website is being updated frequently to make it as
accessible as possible.  If you use assistive technology to
access the Web and encounter problems when using our site, please let
us know. Write to:
<a href="mailto:support@searchusa.zendesk.com">support@searchusa.zendesk.com</a>
and we will attempt to provide the information to you in a suitable
format. It would be helpful if you can be as specific as possible when
describing the information you seek.</p>

<p>In addition, the Search.USA.gov site is also routinely reviewed for
alignment with the latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 
from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>
define how browsers, media players, and other "user agents" support
people with disabilities and work assistive technologies.</p>
