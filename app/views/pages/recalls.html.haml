  Product Recall Data API
%p
  USASearch’s Product Recall Data API returns data on product safety and recalls from three federal government agencies: (1) food safety data from the
  %a{:href=>"http://www.cdc.gov"}
    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;
  (2) car safety data from the
  %a{:href=>"http://www.nhtsa.gov"}
    National Highway Traffic Safety Administration;
  and (3) product safety data from the
  %a{:href=>"http://www.cpsc.gov"}
    Consumer Product Safety Commission.
  The feeds are processed every 30 minutes, when possible.
%p
  The API has two important features of note, both of which are intended to minimize customers’ need to input complex queries while maximizing the recall of search results. First, the API searches all the fields in the database (the full text of the record). Second, the API stems (or performs prefix search) customers’ search terms (for example, allergic and allergy retrieve the same search results).
