  %h4 Important Notes
  %p
    :escaped
      Note that the fields in your XML file are case sensitive and everything must be lower case so enter them as <title>, <url>, and <description>. (The system will prevent you from uploading files using title case or all caps so do not use <Title>, <URL>, <Description>, for example.)
  %p
    Also, be sure to enter a title, url, and description field for every entry. (They are mandatory so the system will prevent you from uploading files without a field for every entry.)
