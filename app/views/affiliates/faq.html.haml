    FAQs: Upgrading the USA.gov Search Affiliates Program
  %p
    We appreciate that you have chosen to use the USA.gov Search Affiliates
    service and hope you will continue your patronage in the future.
  %p
    USA.gov technologies is upgrading the Search Affiliates service. From your perspective, the changes should not be dramatic. You will not be required to make any changes to your web site, and the service is still offered free of charge. You will gain some additional flexibility in control over which services you receive and you will be able to subscribe to new features that are being developed by the USA.gov Search team. We hope the FAQs listed below will address your questions and concerns.

    #whatshappening
      %h2
        What's happening, in a nutshell?
      %p
        The main change is that USA.gov Technologies will no longer be using an outside contractor to act as an intermediary between the USA.gov Search program and the search index provider (which currently is Microsoft). The front-end service will be hosted in the USA.gov infrastructure.
      %p
        You will see a few minor changes to the service, described in another FAQ below.
      %p
        All affiliates will be switched to the new system no later than
        February 24, 2010.  If you have an active service and take no action then
        you will be automatically switched over on or before February 24,
        2010.  You can switch over sooner if you like.

        What will be different in the new Affiliate search service compared to the
        old one?
      %p
        As time goes by we will be soliciting your opinions about what you
        would like added (or subtracted) from the service and the interface.
        Some differences will be visible to users and others will not.  The
        current differences are:

            %li
              The service uses the Bing 2.0 API.

          Visible to users:

            %li
              Related searches from Bing will be shown on the left hand side, although we currently do not have this feature turned on (Affiliates will be able to turn this feature on or off).
            %li
              Clusters (sometimes called topics) will no longer be shown on the
              left hand side.
            %li
              Search results are shown using the standard color scheme.
            %li
              FAQs will no longer be shown embedded into tabs; we expect FAQs
              to appear high in organic search results after the FAQ team completes
              the opening up of the FAQs to web search engines for indexing.
            %li
              Image search will not be offered unless we receive
              requests for it.
    #howadmindifferent
      %h2
        How will administration differ from the current Affiliates program?
      %p
        Under the old program, Affiliates used an administration tool at a contractor's website. Under the new program, a new administrative interface, with new user IDs and passwords, will be constructed and located at a new url. If you are an active affiliate you will receive an email message about how to access the new administration interface when it is ready for use.
      %p
        Using this new administration interface, Affiliate administrators will be able to
        subscribe to or unsubscribe from services. This interface
        will allow Affiliates to chose among a set of customization options,
        and design the headers and footers for their search results
        pages. This website will also  a modern trouble-ticket system that
        Affiliate managers can use to report problems as well as to make
        feature requests.
    #howkeepactive
      %h2
        What do I as an Affiliate administrator need to do to keep
        search working on my Affiliate web site?
      %p
        Although you do not need to make any changes to your site in order to
        keep things working, we do recommend you make a very small change in
        your web pages if you can.  The only change that needs to be made is
        to change
      %ul
        usasearch.gov
      to
      %ul
        search.usa.gov
      %p
        On February 24, 2010, if not sooner, we will redirect the domain name
        of usasearch.gov to search.usa.gov (which is why you do not have to
        change your code), but it is better practice
        and may result in faster response time if you avoid relying on redirects.
    #howtellactive
      %h2
        How can I tell if I have an active site?
      %p
        The new Affiliate administrator tool will eventually show the administrator detailed information about their site usage, including number of queries per day and most frequent queries.
      %p
        After the new service is in place, Affiliate administrators will be
        requested to periodically confirm, via email or the Affiliate
        administration interface, that their site is still active.
    #usebing
      %h2
        Does the new interface still use Microsoft Search (Bing)?
      %p
        The contract for 2009-2010 is for the use of Microsoft's Bing as the backend
        search engine.
    #whowriting
      %h2
        Who is writing the code to support the search interface, and what
        is it written in?
      %p
        A team at USA.gov is developing the code in Ruby on Rails, using agile
        programming methods.  The code is being developed to be entirely unfettered
        by proprietary restrictions.
