            You do not need to include http:// as we recognize URLs with or without it.
            You also do not need to include subdirectories that are covered by higher level subdirectories. For instance,
            if you have yoursite.gov/pages as a domain, you don't need to also specify yoursite.gov/pages/es and yoursite.gov/pages/en,
            as they are both covered by the less specific entry.
          %p.tips
            Entire domain: List yoursite.gov (without www) to search your entire site, including all subdomains.
          %p.tips
            Part of site: List www.yoursite.gov to include only the top-level domain.
            List subagency.yoursite.gov to include lower-level domains
          %p.tips
            Individual pages: List www.yoursite.gov/yourpage.html to include only specific pages.
