Feature: Affiliate clients
  In order to give my searchers a custom search experience
  As an affiliate
  I want to see and manage my affiliate settings

  Scenario: Visiting the affiliate welcome/list page as a un-authenticated Affiliate
    When I go to the affiliate welcome page
    Then I should see "FAQs"
