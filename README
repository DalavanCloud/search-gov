== USASearch Info

= Ruby
You will need Ruby 1.8.7. Verify that your path points to the correct version of Ruby:
lappy:usasearch loren$ ruby -v
ruby 1.8.7 (2009-06-12 patchlevel 174) [i686-darwin10]
lappy:usasearch loren$ which ruby
/opt/local/bin/ruby

You will need to install rubygems 1.3.5 or later:
lappy:usasearch loren$ gem -v
1.3.5
lappy:usasearch loren$ which gem
/opt/local/bin/gem

= Gems
You should be able to get all the gems needed for this project like this:
sudo rake gems:install
sudo rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=test

= Database
The database.yml file assumes you have a local database server up and running (preferably MySQL >= 5.0.85), accessible from user 'root' with no password.
Create and setup your development and test databases:
rake db:create
rake db:create RAILS_ENV=test
rake db:schema:load
rake db:test:prepare

= Tests
Make sure the unit tests and functional tests run:
rake spec

Make sure the integration tests run
script/cucumber

= Analytics
If you are looking at the analytics functionality, it helps to have some sample data in there. This will populate your
development database with a month's worth of data for 100 query terms:
rake usasearch:create_dummy_analytics_data DAYS=30 WORDCOUNT=100

= Running it
Fire up a server and try it all out:
script/server
